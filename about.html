        <p>The STEM Hub for Empowerment (S.H.E) of young women Project is an exciting initiative created by CIHP with funding
            from the centers for disease control and prevention (CDC). It aims to empower young girls by providing them with opportunities
            to engage in technology, digital skills, and financial literacy.
            <br>
            Globally, Adolescent Girls and Young Women(AGYW) aged 15-24 years are at an increased risk of new 
            HIV infection than their male counterparts. In Nigeria, some factors associated with increased AGYW
            risks and vulnerabilities to HIV infection include Gender Based Violence (GBV), limited access
            to education and health care, poverty, are deeply rooted in gender inequalities and inequalities.
            Despite several investments made, these vulnerable groups are still beign left behind, threatning
            attainment of HIV epidemic control by 2030.

    <p>In September, 2023, to reduce these intersecting vulnerabilities to GBV and HIV, the centre for Integrated Health Programs
        (CIHP) in collaboration with (CDC), as part of the (PEPFAR) funded comprehensive HIV prevention, care and treatment
        program in Lagos State, conceptualized and established an incubation hub to prepare and empower vulnerable AGYW
        in diverse fields ofn Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics(STEM); the STEM Hub for Empowerment
        (S.H.E) of young women. In this physical and digital 'safe space' for AGYW, Beneficiaries are provided
        access to youth-friendly, cost-free training and start up support for an initial period of 13 weeks in technical
        (digital marketing skills, technical engineering, basic computer literacy and programming) and soft skills
        (life skills, financial literacy and mental health support) neccessary to unlock their potential in science,
        develop interpersonal, business and leadership skills to thrive.
        <br>
        The pillars of this program are; an operationa training hub, capacity building, resilience building, and mentoring
        and intership.
        <br>
        The goal of the STEM Hub for Empowerment(S.H.E) of younf women is to lrepare and empower vulnerable
        adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) to thrive in the fields of STEM.
    </p>
    <p>The STEM Hub offers a combination of theoretical learning and pratical appllication. Collaborative and 
        innovative approach that encourages members to think critically and creativity.
